For the enclosure, I drew up a quick two-part heart, with a solid back and an open front, and printed that out. Then I realized the the enclosure should probably be able to house the battery and the ESP32 Thing as well, so rather than redesign and reprint it, I simply designed a base that could hold everything. I gave it a couple of little hearts and an infinity symbol to keep with the theme, and printed it in two colors, just because I can. If you're using a dual extruder 3D printer, you'll need to load the DualExtruderBase.stl and DualExptruderBaseInsert.stl files both into Cura (or whatever software you use.) Define one part to be extruded from spool one, the other from spool two. THen select them both, right click, and hit "merge models". The SingleExtruderBase.stl prints the base with the infinity symbol and small hearts inset by 1mm, with a fillet around the edge of the former to aid in printing without the need for support.
