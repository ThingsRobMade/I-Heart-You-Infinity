While I’ve done some app work the old fashioned way, I'd been hearing more about the [MIT App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/) and wanted to give it a shot. Turns out it’s an incredibly fast and simple way to develop apps, from initial layout all the way through to publishing. The interface is intuitive and user friendly, with two primary screens with which you’ll interact.

The first is the Designer screen, where you’ll insert all of your components, both visible (such as images, buttons, etc.), and non-visible (like lists and sensors ), and create the layout that you want. From there, it’s over to the Blocks screen, where you’ll do all of the programming for your components. Even though you’re using the fairly simple style of block-based coding, the App Inventor allows for quite complex functions. Aside from the standard built-in functions, each component type has its own list of functions that you can use.

My app build was super simple, as I wasn’t sure how long it was going to take me to implement. I drew up a quick logo of a heart with the infinity symbol inside it just to give the app some imagery (I also used it for the app icon), then added five buttons - one that’s a simple on/off toggle button, and four others that each trigger a different function for the LEDs. Next to the on/off button, I added a small light bulb icon that is bright yellow when the LEDs are on, and black when they are turned off.

Since this is my first build with App Inventor, it’s extremely primitive. However, I can see potential for some pretty advanced apps using this tool. One thing to note is that, sadly, at this point projects built in the App Inventor cannot be ported to iPhones, although that is something that they’re continuing to pursue.
